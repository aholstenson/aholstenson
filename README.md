## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Andreas Holstenson

I work with user-centered problem solving using technology. You'll find me in 
MalmÃ¶, Sweden. 

I enjoy building things and over the years I've pushed 4218
commits, opened 27 issues and submitted 4 PRs in 
15 repositories. There's currently 
22 repositories around here with 1692 stars.

I'm currently open to new opportunities and spending some time on distributed
systems and storage/search solutions.
